## Description
The UK Department of Transport provides open datasets on road safety and casualties, and one can use these datasets to analyze how safe the roads in the UK are. This project will help you answer a few questions using their 2015 dataset.

- Vehicle: It has all the necessary information about the vehicle and its driver.

- Vehicle_Type: It contains more information about the vehicle involved in an accident.

### Problem
Use aggregate functions in SQL and Python to answer the following sample questions:
